**Project Summary**

ENEE’s1 current liability levels are
equivalent to 9.87% of Honduras’s GDP
and its balance sheets are constantly
negative. This large deficit is a concern
to the central government as a rise in
debt levels is affecting the macroeconomic well-being of the country. Honduras’ electricity sector has been facing key challenges: Electricity losses are high, and some sectors are not paying for their electricity consumption, as a result, ENEE is highly indebted.

We analyze previously unexplored sector data to obtain a better understanding of the sector. Based on our analysis, we recommend the following:

1. Collect on delinquent users in the commercial sector.
2. Address electricity losses through a smart-metering pilot program in the north-west region of the country focusing on the commercial sector.
3. Define a clear subsidy process, establishing how much should be given to each qualifying user.
4. Collect further data: data has been a barrier for further policy analysis. Our analysis raised new questions that could not be addressed with the current level of collected data.
